# {EPITECH} - 101Pong

(We are making a bonus)
Pong, an arcade game developped in 1972 by Ralph Baer (Atari), is the first ever successful video game. It
was inspired by the very first video game, Tennis for Two, developped in 1958 by William Higinbotham on
an oscilloscope




## How to use

If you want to test or use the project, make sure you have Python3 installed.
Otherwise used the command below :
```bash
  py 101Pong x0 y0 z0 x1 y1 z1 n
```
The program will output an error if you do not use 7 integers after "py 101Pong"
The character 'n' of the above command is the parameter used for time,
it is obvious to replace it also by an integer

```bash
  py 101Pong 1.1 3 5 -7 9 2 4
```
The program will come out:
```bash
The velocity vector of the ball is:
(-8.10, 6.00, -3.00)
At time n +  4 , ball coordinates will be:
(-39.40, 33.00, -10.00)
The incidence angle is:
16.57 degrees
```
